# WGANGP-TF
Example of a WGAN-GP implemented using TensorFlow. I used my previous [DCGAN](https://github.com/AndersonNobrega/DCGAN-TF) as the basis for the WGAN architecture.

For a great WGAN tutorial i recommend following [Aladdin Persson's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pG0QZ7OddX4) video.

## Set Up

1. Create python environment with virtualenv
    ```
     virtualenv --python=python3.8 <env_name>
    ```
2. Activate environment before proceeding further
    ```
    source <env_name>/bin/activate
    ```
3. Install dependencies with `requirements.txt`
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
